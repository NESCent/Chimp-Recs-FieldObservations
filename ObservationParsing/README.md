Archiving and metadata extraction for F. Plooij's chimp audio recordings
---------

Scripts for semi-automated parsing of text observation files into CSV files. 

* ``obsparser/production.py`` is the entry point to be run from within Eclipse. 
  Start by modifying the hardwired directories. 
  
The script runs an interactive loop that displays the original file and the proposed parse side-by-side.
