Archiving and metadata extraction for F. Plooij's chimp audio recordings
---------

This repository contains scripts and other code developed in support of Frans Plooij's NESCent project "[Translation of field notes for developmental study of chimpanzee vocal communication](http://nescent.org/science/awards_summary.php?id=199)". Dr. Plooij and his late wife Dr. Hetty van de Rijt-Plooij recorded the largest dataset of audio-recordings from free-living immature chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 1971-73. These recordings were collected along with extensive field notes, transcribed meanwhile in the form of Word documents. The goal of this project was extract the field notes corresponding to each audio recording, and associate them together with other pertinent metadata so that they are appropriate for archiving and sharing at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology's MacAulay Library](http://macaulaylibrary.org/).
